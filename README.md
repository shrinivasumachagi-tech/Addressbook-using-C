# Addressbook-using-C
Address Book Project is a console-based contact management system developed in C. It supports creating, searching, editing, deleting, and saving contacts with strict validation. The project uses structures, file handling, and modular programming on Linux.
# 📘 Address Book Project (C)
This project demonstrates real-world usage of **C programming**, commonly required in **Embedded Systems and Linux-based development**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Address Book Project is designed to store and manage contact details such as **Name, Mobile Number, and Email ID**.  
It supports **creating, searching, editing, deleting, and saving contacts** while enforcing strict input validation rules to ensure data integrity.

## 🚀 Features

- Create new contacts with validation
- Search contacts by:
  - Name
  - Mobile Number
  - Email ID
- Edit contact details:
  - Name
  - Phone Number
  - Email ID
  - All fields
- Delete existing contacts
- Save contacts to a file
- Alphabetical sorting of contacts before saving
- Persistent storage using file handling

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used

### Contacts Structure
```c
typedef struct
{
    char Name[30];
    char Mobile_number[11];
    char Mail_ID[30];
} Contacts;

typedef struct
{
    Contacts contact_details[100];
    int contact_count;
} AddressBook;

#Validation Rules Implemented
🔹 Name Validation

Only alphabets allowed

Spaces permitted

No digits or special characters

🔹 Mobile Number Validation

Must start with digits 6 to 9

Exactly 10 digits

Numeric characters only

Must be unique

🔹 Email ID Validation

Exactly one @ symbol

Must contain .com

Only lowercase letters allowed

No spaces permitted

Domain must appear after @

Must be unique

🔍 Core Functional Modules

valid_name() – Validates contact name

valid_phone_number() – Validates phone number

valid_email_id() – Validates email ID

create_contact() – Adds new contact

list_contacts() – Displays all contacts

search_contacts() – Searches contacts

edit_contact() – Modifies contact details

delete_contact() – Removes a contact

save_contacts() – Saves contacts to file

💾 File Handling

Contacts are stored in data.txt

Data stored in CSV format

Uses standard C file operations:

fopen()

fprintf()

fclose()

Contacts are sorted alphabetically before saving

Ensures persistent storage across executions
